REDIRECTION
	after redirection operator wildcard expansion only if wildcard expands to one filename else ambiguious input error

	HERE_DOC
		//quoted status of delimiter defines if variables in HERE_DOC are expanded or not.
		wildcards are not expanded in HERE_DOC
		//if var is delimiter var does not expand and is used with $var_name as delimiter.

WILDCARD
	if wildcard expansion failed -> gives back string with wildcard character

grep hello && grep bye << END

reads heredoc for grep bye, buffers output
reads input for grep hello, when finished prints buffered output

executes cmd with heredoc first, and buffers.

VARIABLES
	copy env from bash, then use this as your own env. read var names from the copy.
	(do not use getenv)


PARSER
	parsing per pipeline! (not with lexer once at the beginning)
	ignore parts in (), execute them in subshell and pass exit status

var expandage once per pipeline! not for the whole input string!
